TODO: A LOT of this will be moved to a Github wiki whenever this repo is made public. For now this is the easiest place to put everything.

## Survival Aspect
The survival aspect of the modpack implements hunger, temperature, and thirst. The basic things that need to be managed to stay alive. 

#### [ColdSweat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cold-sweat)
- All biomes have a temperature that affects the player's internal temperature.
- If the player gets too hot or too cold, then they will be effected in a negative way and eventually take damage.
- A new sewing table can now add leather, wool, or hides to line armors in order to reduce the rate at which the player's interal temperature changes.
- The Nether is now inhospital. The player will need either a soul lamp or a fire resistant potion to survive for a long period of time there,
  which adds a layer of gating to accessing The Nether.
  
#### [Thirst Was Taken](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thirst-was-taken)
- The player now has a thirst meter, but it isn't nearly as annoying to manage as other thirst mods.
- The biome's temperature (integrated well with Cold Sweat) affects how the player's thirst is drained (dryer and hotter environments drain thirst faster).
- Water bottles now stack to 64 and have multiple levels of purity, which adds an extra layer of complexity while not taking up too much inventory space.
- Purifying and storing water can be automated with the Create mod.
- Integrated very well with mods like Farmer's Delight as meals/drinks will give hydration where it makes sense (i.e., soups and teas give hydration).

#### [Diet](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/diet)
- Diet adds a nutrition system to Minecraft that only provides benefits to incentivize a diverse diet.
- Eating a certain amount of proteins, carbs, vegetables, etc. will provide benefits such as increased hearts and resistance.
- Integrates very well with mods such as Farmer's Delight. Meals made from that mod will increase multiple categories based on the ingredients.
- Benefits & Diet meters will be reset when a player dies, which incentivizes survival & caution.


## Adventure Aspect
The adventure aspect of the modpack is what will encourage player's to explore the world, complete & loot structures, fight bosses, and travel to new dimensions.
This will integrate several mods together in order to create a unique experience. 
- Pufferfish's Skills will be implemented to allow the player to unlock higher tier weapons and armors.
- Create & KubeJS will be used to create a system for creating weapon parts.
- Minecolonies craftsmen will be used to create weapons, armors, create contraptions, and other mod items 
    (anything the player wouldn't need a lot of to reduce tedium. i.e., a mechanic will probably make a steam engine, but not a cog).
- Paragliders & Better Paragliders will be introduce a heart and stamina system to further progression along.
- Several structures will be added via mods like When Dungeons Arise & Dungeon Crawl to provide loot and necessary items for player
    progression.
- End Remastered will gate the End behind various eyes of ender that need to be found throughout both the overworld and the Nether.
- Several mods such as L Ender's Cataclysm, The Graveyard, and Aquamirae will add bosses to the game that can be defeated for unique
    weapons, loot, and possible item's needed for progression.
- New Armors & Weapons have been added via Jet and Elia's Armors & Simply Swords in order to diversify combat options.
- Better Combat & Better Paragliders have been added in order to implement a new combat system that doesn't rely on spam clicking 
    so much. Attacking too much will now deplete stamina and leave you defenseless.
